Hey! The name's Ferdinand, but you can call me Fer.
I'm a huge fan of Sonic and i play a lot of other games like Roblox, The Sims 4, and also many Sonic games! Etc...
I'm very interested in other things too! Like the Titanic incident in 1912, game and video preservation- And much more!
I do have a Youtube channel (although it's kinda abandoned cus i haven't posted much else) with the same name as my username!
